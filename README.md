# Ham10000 Skin Cancer Classification

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project focused on skin Cancer classification using the Ham10000 dataset.
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying these skin Cancer into their respective categories.

## Dataset
The Ham10000 dataset is a collection of 10,000 dermatoscopic images of skin lesions, labeled into seven different classes. 
The dataset can be accessed [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)].

## Project Overview
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Investigate the dataset and prepare images for model training.
2. Model Development: Implement and train different machine learning models.
3. Model Optimization: Fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model accuracy.
4. Interpretation and Visualization: Gain insights into the model's decision-making process.
